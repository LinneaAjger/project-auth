# Project Auth API

Backend project with the aim to learn how to authenticate users and handle passwords in a safe way. The project is also including a frontend part with a form to register and log in users. 

## The problem

Tina and I built this with pair programming. We used node and express to build the backend. It was really good to understand how to store passwords in a safe way. We also did a frontend to connect our mongo database. If we had more time we would also like to add some data to the logged in site. Right now it's just a register/sign in part. We would also like to learn how to reset password by email.
